As resources began to dwindle, both nations clashed over control of the last remaining energy resources on Earth, drawing in client states and annexed territories as both civilian and military resources were harnessed to achieve victory over the other side, all in a struggle that was as much about resources as it was about ideology. The war was marked by atrocities on both sides against foreign and domestic populations, steady escalation of hostilities up to and including the use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and gradual transition of both states into totalitarian dictatorships no different from each other."
